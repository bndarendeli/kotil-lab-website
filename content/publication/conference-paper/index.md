abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable situation. Many approaches can be used to defeat
resistance. One of these approaches is that considers the heterogeneity of the bacterial
population. Resistance can be overcome if bacteria that show resistance in the bacterial
population can be predicted before drug use. Here, we provided a technique with an applied
experimental and computational approach to predict bacterial evolution against the drugs. For
this purpose, we produced the dataset that includes known compounds enriched with twenty-one
novel compounds that we identified for this work. We applied two methods to measure bacterial
resistance against these drugs. In our first method, we have measured the concentration that kills
the single-step mutant, known as a mutant prevention concentration (MPC). Our second method
involved evolution experiments performed for five days with serial passages at pre-determined
drug concentrations. The change in growth rate during the experiments was taken as the output.
The data obtained from these two methods we developed our predictive model, the evolutoinary
escape model (ESM). According to the model's prediction, drugs that develop low resistance
were tested in vitro. Among the molecules tested in vitro, it was determined that KL-4 had
superior properties in delaying the development of resistance. Estimating drug escape routes may
be a promising method to delay resistance. Overall, our approach can foresee antibiotic
resistance and contribute to drug design that delays resistance.
