abstract: When bacteria are forced to grow under stressors or challenging conditions, the most suitable genotype in the population quickly replicates, and then the adaptation occurs. In fact, bacterial populations have various solutions to suit many challenging conditions which underpin evolution. The biggest problem among these solutions is the resistance developed by bacteria against antibiotics, and it is a worrying global problem. A question that is not emphasized enough in antibiotic resistance is, which essential genes in evolving bacteria are more critical to their new state? If this question can be explained in terms of all genes in different conditions, critical genes can be selected, and their relevance with resistance clarified.
To test this hypothesis, we transformed a genome-wide library of CRISPRi plasmids that into the E.coli strain exposed to adaptive laboratory experiments in the presence of five different antibiotics. Then we analyzed single guide RNA presences and counts by Next Generation Sequencing. Thus, we revealed which genes are essential in the post-evolutionary state with their rescuer role. We found 134 essential genes were common in all experimental conditions. Highlighting these rescuer genes is promising in finding convenient new therapies against antibiotic resistance. In addition, these post-evo genes will determine candidate genes or targets in the field of new antibiotic discovery.
